# "Predicting Feed Grain Prices Using Machine Learning: A Data-Driven Approach for Agriculture and Market Analysis"

Source : :https://data.world/cdc2019/agriculture Click here

Overview:

This project aims to predict feed grain prices, a crucial factor for the agriculture and farming industries. Accurate price predictions are essential for farmers, suppliers, and market analysts to make informed decisions regarding production, inventory management, and pricing strategies. Given the fluctuating nature of market demand, seasonal trends, and economic factors, this project leverages machine learning models to forecast feed grain prices accurately.

Objective
The primary objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that predicts feed grain prices based on historical data, geographical information, and temporal factors.


. Data Description:

•	Source: Feed Grain dataset

•	Features:

o	SC_Group_Desc: Describes the group, such as "Prices."

o	SC_GroupCommod_Desc: Describes the commodity (e.g., "Oats").

o	SC_GeographyIndented_Desc: Geographic location.

o	SC_Attribute_Desc: Attribute description, such as "Prices received by farmers."

o	SC_Unit_Desc: Unit of the amount (e.g., "Dollars per bushel").

o	Year_ID: Year of the record.

o	Timeperiod_Desc: Time period (monthly).

o	Amount: Target variable, representing the price.

4. Data Collection:
5. 
•	The dataset is preloaded from the file "FeedGrains.csv."

•	Preliminary analysis shows various commodities and their prices over time.

7. Data Preprocessing - Data Cleaning:

Feature Selection: Identifying the most significant features that influence grain prices.

Model Training: Implementing and training various regression models.

Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics like R2 score and Mean Squared Error (MSE).

Feature Importance Analysis: Understanding the impact of different features on the predicted prices.

Model Saving and Loading: Techniques for saving trained models and loading them for future predictions.

. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

•	Gain insights into data distribution and patterns:

1)Barplot

2)Countplot

3)Boxplot

4)Heatmap

. Hyperparameter Tuning:

•	Use GridSearchCV to tune hyperparameters and optimize model performance.

CONCLUSION

In conclusion, The machine learning model developed in this project has successfully demonstrated its ability to predict feed grain prices with a high degree of accuracy. By leveraging historical data, geographical information, and temporal factors, the model provides valuable insights that can aid farmers, suppliers, and market analysts in making informed decisions regarding production, inventory management, and pricing strategies. The predictive power of this model can help mitigate the challenges posed by market demand fluctuations, seasonal trends, and economic factors.

FUTURE WORK

Future work could focus on integrating additional variables such as weather patterns, global economic indicators, and more granular geographical data to further enhance the model’s accuracy and robustness. Additionally, exploring advanced machine learning techniques and models could provide even more precise predictions, thereby offering greater support to stakeholders in the agricultural sector
